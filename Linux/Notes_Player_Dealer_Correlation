Summary:
Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.
Evidence:
On March 10, 12, and 15th, Lucky Duck lost revenue 13 times. Each time this happened, Mylie Schmidt was playing in the casino. I cross-referrenced the times with dealer schedules and every time Schmidt played, Billy Jones was dealing at the Roulettes table. Therefore, I am concluding that Jones and Schmidt were working together to scam Lucky Duck.
